智慧与道德 的建议
when you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy,
ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the 
facts bear up(拥护，显示), never let yourself be diverted(改变) either by what you 
wish to believe or by what you think could have been efficient social
effects if it were believed, but look only and survey at what are the
facts.
