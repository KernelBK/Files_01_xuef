You can specialize a parameter in two ways--usually you'll specify a class that the argument must be an instance of. Because instances of a class are also considered instances of that class's superclasses, a method with a parameter specialized on a particular class can be applicable whenever the corresponding argument is a direct instance of the specializing class or of any of its subclasses. The other kind of specializer is a so-called `EQL`specializer, which specifies a particular object to which the method applies.

When a generic function has only methods specialized on a single parameter and all the specializers are class specializers, the result of invoking a generic function is quite similar to the result of invoking a method in a message-passing system--the combination of the name of the operation and the class of the object on which it's invoked determines what method to run.

However, reversing the order of lookup opens up possibilities not found in message-passing systems. Generic functions support methods that specialize on multiple parameters, provide a framework that makes multiple inheritance much more manageable, and let you use declarative constructs to control how methods are combined into an effective method, supporting several common usage patterns without a lot of boilerplate code. I'll discuss those topics in a moment. But first you need to look at the basics of the two macros used to define the generic functions `DEFGENERIC` and `DEFMETHOD`.
