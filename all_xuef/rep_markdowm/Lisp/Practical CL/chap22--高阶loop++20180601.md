## 22.2 迭代控制

```
(loop
  for item in list
  for i from 1 to 10
  do (something))
```



## 22.3 计数循环

```lisp
> (loop for i upto 10 collect i)
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
> (loop for i from 0 downto -10 collect i)
```

## 22.4 循环集合与包



## 22.7 解构变量

```
CL-USER> (loop for (a b) in '((1 2) (3 4) (5 6))
            do (format t "a: ~a; b: ~a~%" a b))
a: 1; b: 2
a: 3; b: 4
a: 5; b: 6
NIL
```

```
(loop for (a nil) in '((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)) collect a) ==> (1 3 5)
```

## 22.8 值汇聚

The possible verbs are `collect`, `append`, `nconc`, `count`, `sum`, `maximize`, and `minimize`. Also available as synonyms are the present participle forms:`collecting`, `appending`, `nconcing`, `counting`, `summing`, `maximizing`, and`minimizing`.

```
(defparameter *random* (loop repeat 100 collect (random 10000)))
```

Then the following loop will return a list containing various summary information about the numbers:

下面的循环将返回包含各种关于这些随机数字的统计信息的列表

```lisp
(loop for i in *random*
   counting (evenp i) into evens
   counting (oddp i) into odds
   summing i into total
   maximizing i into max
   minimizing i into min
   finally (return (list min max total evens odds)))
```

## 22.9 无条件执行

```
(loop for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))
```



## 22.10 条件执行

```
(loop for i from 1 to 10 do (when (evenp i) (print i)))
```

```
(loop for i from 1 to 10 when (evenp i) sum i) ==> 30
```

The following loop collects the non-`NIL` values found in `some-hash` when looking up the keys in `some-list`:

```
(loop for key in some-list when (gethash key some-hash) collect it)
```

## 22.11 设置与拆除

```
(loop named outer for list in lists do
     (loop for item in list do
          (if (what-i-am-looking-for-p item)
            (return-from outer item))))
```

## 22.12 终止测试

```
(if (loop for n in numbers always (evenp n))
    (print "All numbers even."))
```

Equivalently you could write the following:

```
(if (loop for n in numbers never (oddp n))
    (print "All numbers even."))
```

```
(loop for char across "abc123" thereis (digit-char-p char)) ==> 1
(loop for char across "abcdef" thereis (digit-char-p char)) ==> NIL
```
