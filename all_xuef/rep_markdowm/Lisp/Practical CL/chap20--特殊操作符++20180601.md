## 20.1 控制求值

The first category of special operators contains the three operators that provide basic control over the evaluation of forms. They're `QUOTE`, `IF`, and `PROGN`, and I've discussed them all already. However, it's worth noting how each of these special operators provides one fundamental kind of control over the evaluation of one or more forms. `QUOTE` prevents evaluation altogether and allows you to get at s-expressions as data. `IF` provides the fundamental boolean choice operation from which all other conditional execution constructs can be built.1 And `PROGN` provides the ability to sequence a number of forms.



## 20.2 操纵词法环境

Any construct, such as a `DO` or `DOTIMES`, that binds lexical variables will have to expand into a `LET` or `LET*`.

flet，labels 创建局部函数（可创建递归）

```
(defun collect-leaves (tree)
  (let ((leaves ()))
    (labels ((walk (tree)
               (cond
                 ((null tree))
                 ((atom tree) (push tree leaves))
                 (t (walk (car tree))
                    (walk (cdr tree))))))
      (walk tree))
    (nreverse leaves)))
```
