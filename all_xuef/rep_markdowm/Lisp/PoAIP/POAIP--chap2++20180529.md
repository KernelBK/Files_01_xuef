## 2.4  Two Paths to Follow

The two versions of the preceding program represent two alternate approaches that
come up time and time again in developing programs: 

+ Use the most straightforward mapping of the problem description directly into Lisp code.
+ Use the most natural notation available to solve the problem, and then worry about writing an

interpreter for that notation.



Approach (2) involves an extra step, and thus is more work for small problems.
However, programs that use this approach are often easier to modify and expand.

2)中的程序易于修改和扩展。

This is especially true in a domain where there is a lot of data to account for. 

The grammar of natural language is one such domain - in fact, most AI problems fit this description. 

这尤其适用于有大量数据要处理的领域。如自然语言的语法。实际上大多数的AI问题都需要处理大量数据。

The idea behind approach  (2)  is to work with the problem as much as possible in its own terms, and to minimize the part of the solution that is written directly in Lisp.



## 2.5  Changing the Grammar without Changing

the Program We show the utility of approach  (2)  by defining a new grammar that includes 

adjectives, prepositional phrases（介词短语）, proper names（专有名词）, and pronouns. （代词）

We can then apply the generate  function without modification to this new grammar.
