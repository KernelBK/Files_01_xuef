如何学习好的编码风格？

阅读大师的代码，并模仿。

How is the programmer to choose between them? 

One answer is by reading examples of good programs - as illustrated in this book - and copying that style.

## 3.1  A  Guide  to  Lisp  Style

- Be specific.

如何可以，使用大家更容易理解的语法和惯用语。避免晦涩。

比如，条件分支，when就比if更好理解。

-Use abstractions.

把代码写的就像一个句子，一段好文章，一本好书。让别人读你的代码，就像读文章一样。

语义化。

-Be concise.
-Use the provided tools.
-Don't be obscure.
-Be consistent.

## 3.2 special forms

| definitions  | conditional | variables | iteration | other    |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| defun        | and         | let       | do        | declare  |
| defstruct    | case        | let*      | do*       | function |
| defvar       | cond        | pop       | dolist    | progn    |
| defparameter | if          | push      | dotimes   | quote    |
| defconstant  | or          | setf      | loop      | return   |
| defmacro     | unless      | incf      |           | trace    |
| labels       | when        | decf      |           | untrace  |



It is considered poor style to use  and  and  or  for anything other than testing a logical condition.  when, unl ess,  and  i  f  can all be used for taking conditional action.

### iteration

dolist  		loop over elements of a list
dotimes  	loop over successive integers
do, do*  		general loop, sparse syntax
loop  		general loop, verbose syntax
mapc, mapcar  loop over elements of lists(s)
some, every  loop over list until condition
find,  reduce,  etc.  more specific looping functions
recursion  	general repetition



## 3.3 Functions on Lists

```lisp
(setf x '(a b c) y '(1 2 3))

(reverse x)
(append x y)
(list x y)
(list* 1 2 x) ;; (1 2 A B C)
(null x)
(lisp x)
(consp x)
(sort y #'>)
(subseq x 1 2)
```



## 3.4 Equality and Internal Representation



## 3.5 Functions on Sequences

```lisp
(nth n list)
(elt sequence n)
(aref array n)
(char string n)
(bit bitvector n)
(sbit simple-bit-vector n)
(svref simple-vector n)
```



## 3.6 Functions for Maintaining Tables

Lisp lists can be used to represent a one-dimensional sequence of objects. Because they are so versatile, they have been put to other purposes, such as representing tables of information. 

Lisp 的 lists 可以被用来表示一维的对象序列，因为它是那么通用。除此还有其他用途，如表示表格信息。

### association list

```lisp
(setf state-table
'(( AL . Alabama) (AK . Alaska) (AZ . Arizona) (AR . Arkansas)))
> (assoc 'AK state-table) ==> (AK . ALASKA)
> (cdr (assoc 'AK state-table))  ==>  ALASKA
> (assoc 'TX state-table)  ==> NIL

;; 根据 val 检索
> (rassoc 'Arizona table)
```



### hashtable

```lisp
(setf table (make-hash-table)
(setf (gethash  'AL  table) 'A1abama)
(setf (gethash  'AK  table) 'A1aska)
(setf (gethash  'AZ  table) 'Arizona)
(setf (gethash  'AR  table) 'Arkansas)
```



### Property/value pairs 

can be stored under a symbol with a setf form. A table would be built as follows:

```lisp
(setf (get 'AL 'state) 'Alabama)
(setf (get 'AK 'state) 'Alaska)
(setf (get 'AZ 'state) 'Arizona)
(setf (get 'AR 'state) 'Arkansas)
```

Now we can retrieve values with get:

```lisp
(get 'AK 'state)  ==> ALASKA
(get 'TX 'state)  ==> NIL
```



## 3.7 Functions  on  Trees

Many Common Lisp functions treat the expression  `((a b) (c) (d e))`  as a sequence of three elements, but there are a few functions that treat it as a tree with five non-null leaves. 

```lisp
>  (setf tree '((a b) ((c)) (d e)))
>  (tree-equal tree (copy-tree tree))  ==>  T
(defun same-shape-tree (a b)
  "Are two trees the same except for the leaves?"
  (tree-equal a b :test #'true))
(defun true (&rest ignore) t)

>  (same-shape-tree tree '((1 2) ((3)) (4 5)))  ==>  T
>  (same-shape-tree tree '((1 2) (3) (4 5)))  ==> NIL
```

```lisp
> (subst 'new 'old '(old ((very old)))  ==>  (NEW ((VERY NEW)))
```



## 3.8 function on numbers



## 3.9 Functions on Sets

One of the important uses of lists is to represent sets.

```lisp
>  (setf r '(a b c d)  ==>  (A  B  C  D)
>  (setf s '(c d e)  ==>  (C D  E)
>  (intersection r s)  ==>  (C D)
```

```xml
(intersection r s)     		find common elements of two sets
(union  r  s)   			find all elements in either of two sets
(set-difference r s)   		find elements in one but not other set
(member 'd r)  				check if an element is a member of a set
(subsetp s r ) 				see if all elements of one set are in another
(adjoin 'b s)  				add an element to a set
(adjoin 'c s)				...but don't add duplicates
```

```lisp
(bit-and  #*11110  #*11001)  ==>  #*11000
(1ogand  #b11110  #b11001)  ==> 24  ==>  #b11000
```

## 3.11 Overview  of  Data  Types

```lisp
(type-of 123)
```



## 3.12 input.output

Input in Lisp is incredibly easy because a complete lexical and syntactic parser is
available to the user. The parser is called  read.  It is used to read and return a single
Lisp expression.



## 3.13 debug tools

```lisp
>  (step (+ 3 4 (* 5 6 (1 7 8))))
```

```lisp
;; 查看所有 带 string 的方法
> (apropos 'string)

>  (describe 'make-string)
```



## Timing Tools

```lisp
>  (time (f 10000)) ==> NIL
>  (compile 'f)  ==>  F
>  (time (f 10000))  ==>  NIL
```

## 3.15 Evaluation

```lisp
>  (+ 1 2 3 4)  = 10
>  (funcall  #'+  1  2 3 4)  = 10
>  (apply  #'+ '(1 2  3 4))  = 10
>  (apply  #'+ 1 2 '(3 4))  = 10
>  (eval '(+ 1 2 3 4))  = 10
```



## 3.16 Closures

What does it mean to create a new function? Certainly every time a function (or  #'') special form is evaluated, a function is returned.

```lisp
(defun adder (c)
  "Return a function that adds c to its argument."
  #'(lambda (x) (+ x c)))
>  (mapcar (adder 3) '(1 3 10))  ==> (4 6 13)
>  (mapcar (adder 10) '(1 3 10))  ==> (11 13 20)
```



Here is another example. The function bank-account returns a closure that can be used as a representation of a bank account. The closure captures the local variable balance. The body of the closure provides code to access and modify the local variable.

```lisp
(defun bank-account (balance)
"Open a bank account starting with the given balance."
  #'(lambda (action amount)
        (case action
          (deposit  (setf balance  (+  balance amount)))
          (withdraw (setf balance  ( -  balance amount))))))
```

```lisp
>  (setf my-account (bank-account 500.00))  =>  #<CLOSURE 52330407>
>  (setf your-account (bank-account 250.00)) =>  #<CLOSURE 52331203>
>  (funcall my-account 'withdraw 75.00)  => 425.0
>  (funcall your-account 'deposit 250.00)  => 500.0
>  (funcall your-account 'withdraw 100.00)  => 400.0
>  (funcall my-account 'withdraw 25.00)  => 400.0
```



## 3.17 Special Variables

Common Lisp provides for two kinds of variables: lexical and special variables. For the begnner, it is tempting to equate the special variables in Common Lisp with global variables in other languages. Unfortunately, this is not quite correct and can lead to problems. It is best to understand Common Lispvariables on their own terms.

By default, Common Lisp variables are lexical variables. Lexical variables are introduced by some syntactic construct like  let  or  defun  and get their name from the fact that they may only be referred to by code that appears lexically within the body of the syntactic construct. The body is called the scope of the variable.

简言之，词法作用域，由 ( ) 决定能否访问某变量。

So far, there is no difference between Common Lisp and other languages. The interesting part is when we consider the extent, or lifetime, of a variable. In other languages, the extent is the same as the scope: a new local variable is created when a block is entered, and the variable goes away when the block is exited. But because it is possible to create new functions - closures - in Lisp, it is therefore possible for code that references a variable to live on after the scope of the variable has been exited.

在其他语言中，当进入一个{ }块时，一个局部变量就被创建了。离开{ }，该变量就消亡了。

在 Lisp 中，因为闭包机制，我们得以在离开该变量的作用域后继续引用该变量。

Consider again the  bank-account  function, which creates a closure representing a bank account:

The function introduces the lexical variable  balance.  The scope of  balance  is the body of the function, and therefore references to  balance  can occur only within this scope. What happens when  bank-account  is called and exited? Once the body of the function has been left, no other code can refer to that instance of  bal ance.  The scope has been exited, but the extent of  balance lives on. We can call the closure, and it can reference  bal ance,  because the code that created the closure appeared lexically within the scope of  bal ance.

&key &optional &rest

```lisp
>  (find 4 '(1 2 3 4 -5 6.0) :test  #'<)  ==> 6.0
>  (find 5 '(1 2 3 4 -5 6.0)  :key #'abs) ==> -5
```



## 3.20 The Rest  of  Lisp

There is a lot more to Common Lisp than what we have seen here, but this overview
should be enough for the reader to comprehend the programs in the chapters to
come. The serious Lisp programmer will further his or her education by continuing
to consult reference books and online documentation. You may also find part  V
of this book to be helpful, particularly chapter 24, which covers advanced features
of Common Lisp (such as packages and error handling) and chapter 25, which is a
collection of troubleshooting hints for the perplexed Lisper.
While it may be distracting for the beginner to be continually looking at some
reference source, the alternative - to explain every new function in complete detail as
it is introduced - would be even more distracting. It would interrupt the description
of the A1 programs, which is what this book is all about.
