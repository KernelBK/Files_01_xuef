What Induction is, therefore, and what conditions render it legitimate, can not
but be deemed the main question of the science of logic—the question which includes all others.

For the purposes of the present inquiry, Induction may
be defined, the operation of discovering and proving general
propositions.

on the one hand, generals are but collections of particulars, definite
in kind but indefinite in number; and on the other hand, whenever
the evidence which we derive from observation of known cases
justifies us in drawing an inference respecting even one unknown
case, we should on the same evidence be justified in drawing
a similar inference with respect to a whole class of cases. The
inference either does not hold at all, or it holds in all cases of
a certain description; in all cases which, in certain definable
respects, resemble those we have observed.


Success is here dependent on
natural or acquired sagacity, aided by knowledge of the particular
subject, and of subjects allied with it. Invention, though it can be
cultivated, can not be reduced to rule; there is no science which
will enable a man to bethink himself of that which will suit his
purpose.


Induction, then, is that operation of the mind, by which we
infer that what we know to be true in a particular case or cases,
will be true in all cases which resemble the former in certain
assignable respects. In other words, Induction is the process by
which we conclude that what is true of certain individuals of a
class is true of the whole class, or that what is true at certain
times will be true in similar circumstances at all times.

 “This and that A are B, therefore every A is B”—is
called an induction, whether any thing be really concluded or
not: and the induction is asserted not to be perfect, unless every
single individual of the class A is included in the antecedent, or
premise: that is, unless what we affirm of the class has already
been ascertained to be true of every individual in it, so that
the nominal conclusion is not really a conclusion, but a mere
re-assertion of the premises.
