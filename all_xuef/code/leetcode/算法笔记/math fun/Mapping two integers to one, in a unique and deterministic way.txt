Imagine two positive integers A and B. I want to combine these two into a single integer C.

There can be no other integers D and E which combine to C. So combining them with the addition operator doesn't work. 
Eg 30 + 10 = 40 = 40 + 0 = 39 + 1 Neither does concatination work. Eg "31" + "2" = 312 = "3" + "12"

This combination operation should also be deterministic (always yield the same result with the same inputs) and should 
always yield an integer on either the positive or the negative side of integers.


	You should clarify if you mean integers in software or integers in math. In software, you pick any integer type and it will have a size, 
	so you have a finite number of them, so there is no solution (unless, of course, your input data is guaranteed to be within some range 
	and your output can be any integer). In math see ASk's solution.
	
You're looking for a bijective NxN -> N mapping. These are used for e.g. dovetailing. Have a look at this PDF for an introduction to 
so-called pairing functions. Wikipedia introduces a specific pairing function, namely the Cantor pairing function:
