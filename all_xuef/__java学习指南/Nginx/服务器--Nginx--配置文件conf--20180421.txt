1. 主配置文件
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
2. 从配置


# 检测配置
nginx -tc /etc/nginx/nginx.conf


Normal NGINX configuration starts with the nginx.conf file (ie /etc/nginx/nginx.conf) which declares the user, 
process id, and other necessary stuff followed by an http { } branch. the server {} branches that are typically 
held in the conf.d directory or else where are typically included at the end of this http{} branch in nginx.conf. 
so even though they start with server as the out node, it's not really the outer node. it's inside the http node.

if you are loading a config file directly maybe make sure it contains a full nginx config, including these missing parts?
