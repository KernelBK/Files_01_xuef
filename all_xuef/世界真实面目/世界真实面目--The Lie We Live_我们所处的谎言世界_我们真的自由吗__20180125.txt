The Lie We Live 
By Spencer Cathcart

At this moment you could be anywhere, doing anything. Instead you sit alone before a screen. 
So what’s stopping us from doing what we want? Being where we want to be?

Each day we wake up in the same room and follow the same path, to live the same day as yesterday. 
Yet at one time each day was a new adventure. Along the way something changed. 
Before our days were timeless, now our days are scheduled.

Is this what it means to be grown up? To be free? But are we really free?

Food, water, land.

The very elements we need to survive are owned by corporations. 
There’s no food for us on trees, no freshwater in streams, no land to build a home.
If you try and take what the Earth provides you’ll be locked away. So we obey their rules.

We discover the world through a textbook. For years we sit and regurgitate what we’re told. 
Tested and graded like subjects in a lab. Raised not to make a difference in this world, 
raised to be no different. Smart enough to do our job but not to question why we do it. 
So we work and work, left with no time to live the life we work for. Until a day comes when 
we are too old to do our job. It is here we are left to die. Our children take our place in the game.

To us our path is unique, but together we are nothing more than fuel. The fuel that powers the elite. 
The elite who hide behind the logos of corporations. This is their world. And their most valuable resource 
is not in the ground. It is us.

We build their cities, we run their machines, we fight their wars. After all, money isn’t what drives them. 
It’s power. Money is simply the tool they use to control us. 
Worthless pieces of paper we depend on to feed us, move us, entertain us. 

They gave us money and in return we gave them the world. Where there were trees that cleaned our air 
are now factories that poison it. Where there was water to drink, is toxic waste that stinks. 
Where animals ran free, are factory farms where they are born and slaughtered endlessly for our satisfaction. 
Over a billion people are starving, despite us having enough food for everybody. 
Where does it all go? 70% of the grain we grow is fed to fatten the animals you eat for dinner. 
Why help the starving? You can’t profit off them.(为何要援助饥饿？你又不能从中获利)

We are like a plague(瘟疫) sweeping the earth, tearing apart the very environment that allows us to live. 
We see everything as something to be sold, as an object to be owned. But what happens when we have polluted the last river? 
Poisoned the last breath of air? Have no oil for the trucks that bring us our food? 
When will we realize money can’t be eaten, that it has no value?

We aren’t destroying the planet. We are destroying all life on it. Every year thousands of species go extinct. 
And time is running out before we’re next. If you live in America there’s a 41% chance you’ll get cancer. 
Heart disease will kill one out of three Americans.  We take prescription drugs to deal with these problems, 
but medical care is the third leading cause of death behind cancer and heart disease. We’re told everything can 
be solved by throwing money at scientists so they can discover a pill to make our problems go away. 
But the drug companies and cancer societies rely on our suffering to make a profit. 
We think we’re running for a cure, but really we’re running away from the cause. 
Our body is a product of what we consume and the food we eat is designed purely for profit.  
We fill ourselves with toxic chemicals. The bodies of animals infested with drugs and diseases. 
But we don’t see this. The small group of corporations that own the media don’t want us to. 
Surrounding us with a fantasy(幻想) we’re told is reality. 

It’s funny to think humans once thought the earth was the center of the universe.  
But then again, now we see ourselves as the center of the planet. We point to our technology and say we’re the smartest. 
But do computers, cars, and factories really illustrate how intelligent we are? Or do they show how lazy we’ve become. 
We put this “civilized” mask on. But when you strip that away what are we?

How quickly we forget only within past hundred years did we allow women to vote; allow blacks to live as equals. 
We act as if we are all-knowing beings, yet there is much we fail to see. We walk down the street ignoring all the little things. 
The eyes who stare. The stories they share. Seeing everything as a background to ‘me’.

Perhaps we fear we’re not alone. That we are a part of a much bigger picture. But we fail to make the connection. 
We’re okay killing pigs, cows, chickens, strangers from foreign lands. But not our neighbours, not our dogs, our cats,
those we have come to love and understand. We call other creatures stupid yet we point to them to justify our actions. 
But does killing simply because we can, because we always have, make it right? Or does it show how little we’ve learned.  
That we continue to act out of primal aggression rather than thought and compassion.

One day, this sensation we call life will leave us. Our bodies will rot, our valuables recollected. 
Yesterday’s actions all that remain. Death constantly surrounds us, still it seems so distant from our everyday reality. 
We live in a world on the verge of collapse. The wars of tomorrow will have no winners. For violence will never be the answer; 
it will destroy every possible solution.

If we all look at our innermost desire, we will see our dreams are not so different. We share a common goal. 
Happiness. We tear the world apart looking for joy, without ever looking within ourselves. Many of the happiest people 
are those who own the least.  But are we really so happy with our iPhones, our big houses, our fancy cars? 

We’ve become disconnected. Idolizing people we’ve never met. We witness the extraordinary on screens but ordinary everywhere else. 
We wait for someone to bring change without ever thinking of changing ourselves.

Presidential elections might as well be a coin toss. It’s two sides of the same coin. We choose which face we want and 
the illusion of choice, of change is created. But the world remains the same. We fail to realize the politicians don’t serve us; 
they serve those who fund them into power. 

We need leaders, not politicians. But in this world of followers, we have forgotten to lead ourselves. 
Stop waiting for change and be the change you want to see. We didn’t get to this point by sitting on our asses. 
The human race survived not because we are fastest or the strongest, but because we worked together.

We have mastered the act of killing. Now let’s master the joy of living.

This isn’t about saving the planet. The planet will be here whether we are or not. Earth has been around for billions of years, 
each of us will be lucky to last eighty. We are a flash in time, but our impact is forever.

I often wished I lived in an age before computers, when we didn’t have screens to distract us.
But I realize there's one reason why this is the only time I want to be alive. Because here today, we have an opportunity 
we never had before. The internet gives us the power to share a message and unite millions around the world. 
While we still can we must use our screens to bring us closer together, rather than farther apart.

For better or worse, our generation will determine the future of life on this planet. We can either continue to serve 
this system of destruction until no memory of our existence remains. Or we can wake up. Realize we aren’t evolving upwards, 
but rather falling down...we just have screens in our faces so we don’t see where we’re heading.

This present moment is what every step, every breath and every death has led to. We are the faces of all who came before us. 
And now it is our turn. You can choose to carve your own path or follow the road countless others have already taken. 

Life is not a movie. The script isn’t already written. We are the writers.

This is Your Story, Their Story, Our Story.

@ xuef
世界不是按照我们的理想就能塑造的，这是个现实存在。
如何不用一些东西（欺骗，意识形态）来驱使每个人都努力工作，那得有很多人饿死，巨大的欲望和私有制制造了
今天的繁荣，也带来了巨大的贫富差距。但是我们要直面和尝试解决这个问题。

囚徒困境
1. human nature
we are irrational animals driven by instincts(本能驱使的非理性动物。这一点很重要)
部落人 不相信外人 冲突不断
we are territorial 
we are possessive(占有欲强的)
we have a strong ego(自我)
a huge sexual appetite

为了克服这些
look inwardly
become aware of yourself
self-awareness 是你超越动物本性的唯一依靠

# educational system
它的目标是 dumb you down(好奇到麻木)
indoctrination system(教化系统)
become an adult that don't have a fucking clue of how the world works
如果只学学校教的，最后肯定变成sb。unless you do research by ourselves
they want obedient works

# media 
1. distract you(virtual reality. make you do not pay attention to the real world)
illusion 幻觉，错觉；错误的观念或信仰
you do whatever the tube tells you, dress like the tube, think like the tube
2. misinform you(误传；提供错误消息)
through movies news and documentaries.
the elites will give you the fake view of the world you live in.
they don't want you to understand the reality and therefore they will implant(植入) in your mind lies
and propaganda in order to turn you an ignorant submissive(顺从的) citizen unable to
comprehend the world around him and then able to become aware of his condition of slave.
3. bombard you with images
turn you superficial and stupid
develop behaviors that bebefits the elites
you'll be persuade to spend your wealth in things that you don't need.
you'll be brainwashed to feel unhappy with yourself so that you'll spend all your life
looking yourself in the mirrors instead of looking the world you live in it.
you'll be implanted needs that will keep you focused in irrelevant things.
use propaganda lies and false flag terror attacks to implant in your mind.
the elites have created an unfair economical system that only benefits a few and to 
prevent the masses(大众) from raising against them.
they will try to keep you divided and confronted with each other.
be aware of the intentions of the countless meggages promoting hatred.

# you'll live in a society that will surround you with countless distractions
the elites will want you to spend your life entertained distracted unaware of the important
political events that are unfolding(发生，展开) around you. 
video games, virtual reality with drugs with big variety of TV programs, pornography.
keep the idiots preoccupied with things that don't mean anything.
让你没时间，而且大脑也愚钝，无法寻求真理。
世界的一切都在阻止你充分发掘自己的潜力。
prevent most of us to learn the right knowledge and wake up.
please be self-aware and meditate(沉思，反思) a liitle bit everyday.
stop watching screens and stop believe the bullshit that the corporate media will tell.
be compassionate
不要被意识形态，偏见和恐惧支配。
learn from the mistakes of our past
