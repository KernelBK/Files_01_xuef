Because programs are just strings of characters, our front end needs to group
these characters into meaningful units.
This grouping is usually divided into two stages: scanning and parsing.

Parsing is the process of organizing the sequence of tokens into hierarchical
syntactic structures such as expressions, statements, and blocks. This
is like organizing (diagramming) a sentence into clauses.
