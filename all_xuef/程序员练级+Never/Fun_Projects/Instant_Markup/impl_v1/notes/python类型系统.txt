In the last few years, type annotation syntax and semantics 
were gradually introduced to Python language.

Now, generally speaking, a type is a type checker concept and a class is a runtime concept. 


But what is a type checker? It’s a tool that analyses our code (similar to flake8, but way smarter). 
It doesn’t run our code in any way, but statically checks the code for type consistency.
