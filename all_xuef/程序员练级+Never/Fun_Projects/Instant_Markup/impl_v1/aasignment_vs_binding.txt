{assignment vs binding}

# assignment vs binding

We will be concerned primarily with a single effect: assignment to a location in memory. 
How does assignment differ from binding? As we have seen, binding is local, 
but variable assignment is potentially global. 
It is about the sharing of values between otherwise unrelatedportions of the computation. 
Two procedures can share information if they both know about the same location in memory. 
A single procedure can share information with a future invocation of itself by leaving the 
information in a known location.
