```
Which part of (f (g (h i) j) k) can be done first? 
(h i), since it must be evaluated before (g (h i) j) can be applied.

What about (f (g (h i) (j k)))? Scheme doesn't specify the order in
which arguments are evaluated so it could be either (h i) or (j k).

So, let's take control. (h i (lambda (hi) ...)) We assume that hi is
the result of applying (h i). Then, we drop in everything else that
has to be done to replace the ...:

(f (g (h i) (j l)))

becomes

(h i (lambda (hi) (f (g hi (j l)))))
