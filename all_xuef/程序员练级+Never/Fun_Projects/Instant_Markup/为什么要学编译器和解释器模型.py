#Compilers are not only for programming languages,
#they are in many more places than you might think!
"""
This series of blog posts will show you how to make a compiler from scratch.
The techniques displayed here will not only help you write compilers,
but will give you the tools to solve a whole type of similar problems which---
in the programming world---happen quite frequently.
"""

##A compiler is just a black box which translates input in a given language to output
##in another language. The input and output languages can be anything.

#You’ll learn about tokenization, parsing, and code-generation.
"""
Some of the things you might want to do afterwards include making your own:

Programming language
Virtual machine
Template engine
Scripting language
DSL
JSON parser
Syntax checker
Synax highlighter
Smart code renaming
Smart autocomplete…
..and more. The sky is the limit!
