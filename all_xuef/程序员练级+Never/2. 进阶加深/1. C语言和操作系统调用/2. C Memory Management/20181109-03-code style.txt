Recall that and array of size n with objects of type t is just a block of memory of size 
sizeof(t) * n.

1. Test for equality with the constant on the left-hand side.
	if (3 == x) /* rather than (x == 3) {
		. . .
	}
2. Initialize pointers to NULL.
	int* p = NULL;
	int* q;  /* Unitialized , q will point to junk . */
