## Preprocessor
Translation of # directives.
•  Translates all macros (#DEFINE’s) into inline C code.
宏替换
•  Takes #include files and inserts them into the code.
将 #include files 插入代码
•  Get redefinition error if structs etc. are defined more than once!
•  Use #ifndef directive to define things only if they have not been defined.
	#ifndef  HEADER NAME
	#define  HEADER NAME
	/* Header code here. */
	#endif


## Parsing and translation
Translates to assembly, performing optimizations.

## Assembler
Translates assembly to machine instructions.

## Linking
•  Static. 
For each function called by the program, the assembly
to that function is included directly in the executable, allowing
function calls to directly address code.
•  Dynamic. Function calls call a Procedure Linkage Table,
which contains the proper addresses of the mapped memory.
