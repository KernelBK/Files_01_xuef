# we can support it without seriously violating our abstraction barriers.
# Type dispatching. One way to implement cross-type operations is to
# select behavior based on the types of the arguments to a function or method.
# The idea of type dispatching is to write functions that inspect the type of
# arguments they receive, then execute code that is appropriate for those types.
