#The core of functional programming is the use of pure functions to map values from
#the input domain to the output range. 
#A pure function has no side effects, a relatively easy threshold for us to achieve in Python.

##Avoiding side effects also means reducing our dependence on variable assignment
##to maintain the state of our computations. 

"""
•  Pure Functions, free of side effects
•  Functions as objects that can be passed as arguments or returned as results
•  The use of Python strings using object-oriented suffix notation and prefix notation
•  Using tuples and namedtuples as a way to create stateless objects
•  Using iterable collections as our primary design tool for functional programming
