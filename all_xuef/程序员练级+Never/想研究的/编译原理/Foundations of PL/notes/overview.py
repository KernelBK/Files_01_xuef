"""
Good languages make it easier to establish, verify, and
maintain the relationship between code and its
properties. —Robert Harper

"""
Some objective criteria
• Is the grammar LALR(1)?
• Is the language type-safe?
• Is the language dynamically or statically typed?
• Is the language Turing-complete?
• Is the language call-by-value or call-by-name?
• Is the language completely specified?
• Does the language require a heap?
• Does the language require dynamic dispatch?

##Basic Tools
"""
• Type theory: Techniques for structuring languages to ensure safety and
modularity of programs

• Operational semantics: Techniques for describing the execution behavior of programs,
at various level of abstraction

• Mathematical logic: Techniques for specifying and verifying programs
