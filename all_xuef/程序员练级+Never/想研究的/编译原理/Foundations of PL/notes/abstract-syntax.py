"""
Grammars, as we have discussed them so far, define a formal language
as a set of strings. We refer to this as the concrete syntax of a language.
While this is necessary in the complete definition of a programming language, it
is only the beginning. We further have to define at least the static semantics
(via typing rules) and the dynamic semantics (via evaluation rules).
