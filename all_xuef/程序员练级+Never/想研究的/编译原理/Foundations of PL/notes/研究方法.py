
#Approach I: Vivisection(解剖)
"""
• Take one or several living languages, preferably widely used
• Analyze it or them in minute detail
• Syntax: Grammar and parsing
• Semantics: Type-checking and operational semantics
• Pragmatics: Programming methodology and implementation strategies
• Can be interesting and instructive
• Not our approach
"""

#Approach V: Study Basic Concepts
"""
• Ignore issues of syntax (largely)
• Isolate and investigate basic concepts, such as
• Functions, procedures, and variables
• Classes, objects, and methods
• Effect-free vs. imperative programming
• Static vs. dynamic typing
• Concrete vs. abstract types
• Sequential vs. concurrent vs. parallel prog.
• Emphasize mathematical tools
• This is our approach!
"""

#After this course, you should be able to
"""
• confidently critique existing languages
• define and analyze your own language
• prove properties of languages
• avoid common mistakes and pitfalls
• reflect more deeply on programming style
• write better programs(?)
• carry out research on programming languages
"""
