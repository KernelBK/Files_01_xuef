#Parsing
"""
The process of finding a derivation for a given string is called parsing;

Note that for our arithmetic grammar, whenever we need to make a decision
as to which production to use, the next terminal of the input always tells us
which choice to make. This sort of algorithm is called a recursive-descent parser.
