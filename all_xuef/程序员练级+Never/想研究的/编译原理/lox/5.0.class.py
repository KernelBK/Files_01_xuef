"""
Even if you personally don’t like OOP, this chapter and the next will help you
understand how others design and build object systems.

##OOP and classes
"""
There are three broad paths to object-oriented programming: classes, prototypes,
and multimethods. Classes came first and are the most popular style.
With the rise of JavaScript (and to a lesser extent Lua), prototypes are more widely
known than they used to be. I’ll talk more about those later.
For Lox, we’re taking the, ahem, classic approach.

###about oop
"""
The main goal is to bundle(归拢) data with the code that acts on it.
Users do that by declaring a class that:
1.Exposes a constructor to create and initialize new instances of the class.

2.Provides a way to store and access fields on instances.

3.Defines a set of methods shared by all instances of the class that operate on the
instances’ state.
