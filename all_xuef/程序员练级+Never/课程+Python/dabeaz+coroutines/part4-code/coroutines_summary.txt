From Data Processing to Concurrent Programming


The Story So Far
• Coroutines are similar to generators
• You can create collections of small processing components and connect them together
• You can process data by setting up pipelines, dataflow graphs, etc.
• You can use coroutines with code that has tricky execution (e.g., event driven systems)
• However, there is so much more going on...
